# Car-Price-Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to build a predictive model for estimating car prices based on various features such as brand, model, year, mileage, fuel type, and more. The model utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze historical data and predict the price of a car based on its attributes.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about different cars, including:

- **Brand**: Manufacturer of the car
- **Model**: Specific model of the car
- **Year**: Year of manufacture
- **Mileage**: Total kilometers driven
- **Fuel Type**: Petrol, Diesel, Electric, etc.
- **Transmission**: Manual or Automatic
- **Engine Size**: Engine capacity in liters
- **Price**: Target variable (dependent variable)

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing:
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Normalizing numerical features

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Visualizing correlations
- Identifying trends and patterns

### Model Selection & Training:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Evaluating models using RMSE, RÂ² score

### Hyperparameter Tuning:
- GridSearchCV for optimizing model parameters

### Prediction & Evaluation:
- Comparing actual vs. predicted prices
- Deploying the model for real-world use

## Installation & Setup
To run this project, follow these steps:

## Usage

- Load the dataset into the notebook.
